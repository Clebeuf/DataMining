# Course Project for Data Mining
### SENG 474 & CSC 578D

**Overview:**
* For the scope of this project we will be trying to predict the freshness rating for a movie, based on the user reviews.  In order to enhance our predictions, we will be analyzing the sentiment of Rotten Tomatoe Reviews.

**Data Sources:**
